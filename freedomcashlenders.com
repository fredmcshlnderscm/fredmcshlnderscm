To apply for a small personal loan, you usually start with a preapproval form with a lending network, like one of the companies on this list. The preapproval step includes a soft credit check to verify your credit score and other basic details.

From there, the lending network will recommend one or more small loan companies that it thinks will approve your application. The lender will likely request more information. In many personal loan approvals, the lender will also check your credit score before making a decision.

You should review the details in your short-term loan offer, including the:

    Repayment terms
    APR/interest rate
    Monthly payment amount
    Consequences for default or other issues with your loan account
