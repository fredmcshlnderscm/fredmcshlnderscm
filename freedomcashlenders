Although there was a time when a poor credit score may have prevented you from obtaining even the smallest loan, the lending industry has become a more diverse place. In particular, the growth of the online lending marketplace has helped inspire an influx of non-bank lenders, as well as providing consumers with greater access to lenders from other geographic locations around the country.

In fact, today’s market has a hearty subprime sector, full of lenders happy to offer loans to those considered too risky by many traditional lenders. Online loans for bad credit are not nearly as few and far between as they once were. And while your ability to qualify for any given loan still depends on your individual financial situation and credit profile — as well as the type of loan itself — your options for finding flexible lenders are better than ever.
