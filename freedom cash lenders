When seeking out a short-term cash advance loan, remember that you will be obligated to pay a very high interest rate for your loan, often in the form of a flat-fee finance charge. This can be as much as $30 for every $100 borrowed.

Youâ€™ll also need to repay the loan in a single lump sum, leading some borrowers who cannot meet their obligation to take out additional loans to pay off the first. This cycle often causes fees and charges to snowball, creating a large debt that the borrower cannot repay.

In fact, the short-term loan issue has gotten so out of hand in some places that the very nature of short-term loans may be changing, as organizations work to have new rules and regulations considered and enacted. For instance, short-term lenders in Colorado must follow a structure that requires all small loans to be repayable in installments.
